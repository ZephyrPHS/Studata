  <h2>Student Database</h2>
  	<h3>Creating/Editing/Deleting a Student</h3>
  		<p>To create a new student, click "Add Student" and then fill out the name, grade, ID, disability, case manager, and annual review date fields. Then click "Save" to create that student. To edit an existing student, click "edit" next to the desired student in the actions section and edit the fields that appear in the top left of the screen. Once again, click "Save" to save your changes. You may also click "Cancel" next to the save button at any time to abort the creation/editing process. Finally, click the "Delete" button in the actions section to delete a student from the database (NOTE: this action is irreversible).</p>
  
  	<h3>Search Bar</h3>
  		<p>You may use the search bar in the top left of the page to search for students based on any fields (name, Grade, ID number, disability, manager, annual review date). Enter the desired search parameter into the searchbar, click "Search", and only students that fit the search parameter will be displayed. Click "Clear Search" to eliminate the search parameter, and the database will go back to displaying all students.</p>
  	<h3>Export Student Data</h3>
    	<p>The export feature will export an individual student's data to a .CSV file which will automatically download on your computer. These files can be opened with Excel or uploaded to Google Sheets. The data exported will include all a student's basic information, and all their goal and objejctive information. To export a student's data, click the "Export" button in the actions section.</p>
  	<h3>View Goals</h3>
  		<p>To view goals for a particular student, click the "View" button in the actions section.</p>
    
  <h2>Goals Page</h2>
  	<h3>Add/Edit/Delete a Goal</h3>
  		<p>To create a new goal, click the "Add Goal" button in the top left of the page. Fill out the fields (ID, name, category, progress, notes) and click "Save" to create that goal. To edit a goal, click the "Edit" button in the actions section, make changes to the fields, and click "Save" to save your changes. Click "Cancel" while creating or editing a goal to abort the process. Click the "Delete" button in the actions section to delete a goal (NOTE: this action is irreversible).</p>
    <h3>View Objectives</h3>
    	<p>To view objectives for a particular goal, click the "View" button in the actions section.</p>
  <h2>Objectives Page</h2>
  	<h3>Add/Edit/Delete an Objective</h3>
		<p>The process for adding, editing, and deleting objectives is the same as the process for adding, editing, and deleting goals, with the only difference being the fields you fill out for each one. Objective fields are: ID, name, progress, and notes.</p>
